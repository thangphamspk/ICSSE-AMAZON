Chronologically, HCMUTE has been renamed several times due to integration with other schools or its own promotion. The university evolved from the Board of Technical Education, first founded on October 5th 1962, then renamed Nguyen Truong To Center for Technical Education in Thu Duc in September 1972, and later upgraded to Thu Duc College of Education in 1974. On October 27th 1976, the SRV Prime Minister issued a decision to establish Thu Duc University of Technical Education on the basis of Thu Duc College of Education. This was amalgamated with Thu Duc Industrial Vocational School in 1984 and further merged with Technical Teacher Training School No.5 in 1991 to become the present Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology And Education. In 1995, the university incorporated with National University Ho Chi Minh City as an informal member. In 2000, HCMUTE became a member under supervision of Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam (MoET).<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://icsse2017.hcmute.edu.vn/Resources/Images/SubDomain/icsse2017/hinh%20truong.jpg\" style=\"height:399px;

However, if the nonlinear system is affected by the disturbance or/and uncertainty, this design work becomes much more difficult. In this talk, we will introduce the observer or/and controller synthesis for the uncertain nonlinear system which is represented as the T-S fuzzy system model, polynomial system model, and polynomial fuzzy system model, respectively. In these models, the exact form and the upper bound of the uncertainty can be unknown. Based on the unknown input method, the effect of the uncertainty or disturbance will be eliminated. Simultaneously, the observer can be synthesized with some conditions being satisfied. Furthermore, we also introduce the observer based controller synthesis for the uncertain polynomial system. In the study, the un-measurable states are estimated and the stability of the system is guaranteed. To deal with the above problems, the non-common quadratic Lyapunov function, Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) technique, and Sum-of-Square (SOS) technique are used to derive the sufficient conditions for the observer and controller synthesis for the uncertain nonlinear system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>About the Speaker:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://icsse2017.hcmute.edu.vn/Resources/Images/SubDomain/icsse2017/%E9%99%A2%E6%9B%BF%E6%88%91%E7%85%A7%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E9%A0%AD%E7%85%A7.jpg\" style=\"height:237px; width:200px\" />&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Wen-June Wang received the B.S.
